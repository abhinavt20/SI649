    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Elections show us what people are thinking as a whole, influenced by who they like, their backgrounds, and what's happening in different states. The 2020 Presidential Election was no different, highlighting the country's divisions and changing political views. This article looks at how people's demographics affected how they voted, examines trends in state elections, and tracks how Joe Biden and Donald Trump were viewed over time. By tying these ideas together, we hope to get a sense of what they might mean for the future of elections in the U.S.</p>

    <h2>Demographic Voting Patterns in 2020</h2>
    <p>The 2020 Presidential Election wasn’t just about picking a leader; it also showed the diversity and complexity of the American voters. More people than ever turned out to vote, even with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at how different groups voted—by gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, and religion—gives us a clearer picture of how Americans make political choices.</p>

    <h3>Gender Divides</h3>
    <p>Gender played a big role in how people voted. Women strongly supported Joe Biden, with 55% voting for him compared to Donald Trump’s 44%. This reflects trends where women often focus on issues like healthcare, reproductive rights, and social equality, which were key parts of Biden’s campaign. Men, on the other hand, leaned slightly toward Trump, giving him 50% of their votes compared to Biden’s 48%. This difference shows how gender often shapes political priorities, with men drawn to Trump’s focus on economic growth and national security (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <h3>Racial and Ethnic Differences</h3>
    <p>Race and ethnicity were major factors in the election. Black voters overwhelmingly supported Biden, with 92% voting for him. This loyalty is tied to the Democratic Party’s emphasis on civil rights and social justice. Hispanic voters also leaned toward Biden at 61%, though there were differences within the group. For example, Cuban Americans in Florida were more likely to support Trump due to his strong stance against socialism (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <h3>Income and Economic Concerns</h3>
    <p>Income influenced how people voted. Among those earning less than $50,000 a year, 54% supported Biden, while 44% voted for Trump, reflecting a focus on issues like healthcare and social safety nets. Voters earning $50,000 to $100,000 were more divided, with Trump narrowly leading at 52% to Biden’s 47%. For those earning over $100,000, Biden regained the lead with 55%, showing that wealthier voters, especially in cities and suburbs, were drawn to his tax policies and progressive views (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <h3>Educational Polarization</h3>
    <p>Education was a clear predictor of voting behavior. Biden led among voters with postgraduate degrees, securing 67% of their votes compared to Trump’s 32%. He also had a majority among voters with four-year college degrees at 56%. However, Trump performed better with those who had some college education (50%) or just a high school diploma or less (56%) (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <h3>Religious Affiliations and Attendance</h3>
    <p>Religion also shaped voter preferences. Trump led among Protestants with 59% of their votes compared to Biden’s 40%, and he was especially popular with White evangelical Protestants, who gave him 83% support. Biden did well with Catholics, narrowly leading 50% to 49%, and performed strongly among Hispanic Catholics, with 66% supporting him (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <p>Biden’s strongest support came from voters with no religious affiliation, such as atheists, agnostics, and those identifying as "nothing in particular," who gave him 71% of their votes. This reflects the Democratic Party’s appeal to secular and progressive values, especially as younger, less religious voters grow in numbers (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <p>Religious attendance also made a difference. People who attended services at least monthly favored Trump, with 59% of their votes. Those who attended less often were more likely to support Biden, with 58%. This divide highlights cultural and ideological differences between more religious and secular voters (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <h3>Urban, Suburban, and Rural Dynamics</h3>
    <p>Where people live often reflects their cultural and economic views. Biden won in urban areas, getting 66% of the vote compared to Trump’s 32%. Suburban areas were closer, but Biden still led with 54% to Trump’s 44%. Rural areas were Trump’s stronghold, with 65% supporting him compared to Biden’s 34% (Pew Research, 2023).</p>
    
    <p>Among White voters, geography made a big difference. Urban White voters leaned toward Biden (59%), while suburban White voters were more evenly split, with 47% supporting Biden and 51% backing Trump. Rural White voters strongly favored Trump, with 71% voting for him. This geographic divide reflects the cultural differences between progressive urban centers and more conservative rural areas (Pew Research, 2023).</p>

    <h2>State-Level Dynamics: Composite Socio-Political Scores</h2>
    <p>Understanding state-level voting behavior requires analyzing a combination of factors that influence a region's cultural, economic, and social landscape. The composite socio-political score integrates three critical components—education, income, and religion—to provide a nuanced view of electoral dynamics across states. Each factor is adjusted to make comparisons fair, and the composite score is a weighted average of these components.</p>

    <figure style= "align-items: center; margin: -70px -30px">
        <iframe 
            src="chart2.html" 
            style="width:1400px; height:840px; border:none; transform: scale(.8); overflow:hidden;">
        </iframe>
        <figcaption style="align-items: center; margin: -70px -30px 100px 30px">Figure 3: Composite Score by State and 2020 Presidential Election Results</figcaption> 
    </figure>

    <h3>How the Composite Score Works</h3>
    <p>The composite score is designed to reflect the relative performance of states in education, income, and religion. Here's how each component contributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Measures the level of educational attainment in a state. Higher scores indicate a greater percentage of residents with advanced degrees or higher education levels, often correlated with progressive voting trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Income:</strong> Shows how economically strong a state is, based on average income levels. States with higher scores tend to have stronger economies and higher living costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Tracks how important religion is in a state, based on how many people identify as religious or attend services regularly.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The composite score combines these factors to give an overall picture of a state's social and political profile. For example, a state with high education and income but low religiosity might still rank high overall, but its position could change if religion is weighed more heavily.</p>
    
    <h3>Interpreting the Composite Score</h3>
    <p>To fully understand the composite score, it’s essential to consider how different components interact and what their implications are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All Components Selected:</strong> A balanced view of education, income, and religion. States with high scores do well in all areas, showing a mix of educational achievement, economic success, and cultural balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Education Only:</strong> States like Massachusetts and Colorado rank high due to strong ties between education levels and progressive values, often favoring Democrats.</li>
        <li><strong>Income Only:</strong> Wealthy states like Connecticut and New Jersey rank higher, showing the role of economic strength in shaping voter preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Religion Only:</strong> States like Mississippi and Alabama dominate when religion is the focus, reflecting their strong ties to conservative and religious values.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It’s important to note that a high score in any one category does not inherently indicate better or worse performance—it simply reflects the prominence of that factor in the state’s overall socio-political makeup. For example, a high religion score might suggest a cohesive cultural identity in some states, while in others, it might highlight ideological divides.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Findings from the Composite Score</h2>
    <p>The composite score reveals clear patterns in how states vote by integrating education, income, and religion. States with high composite scores, such as Massachusetts, Colorado, and Connecticut, are Democratic strongholds. These states combine high education levels, strong economies, and lower religious influence. Their focus on issues like healthcare, climate change, and equality aligns with Democratic policies, making them reliable blue states. These states also attract diverse populations and drive innovation, reinforcing their progressive leanings (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023).</p>
    
    <h4>High Composite Scores and Democratic Voting</h3>
    <p>States like Massachusetts, Colorado, and Connecticut, which rank high in the composite score, strongly supported Joe Biden in 2020. Their mix of high education levels, strong economies, and moderate religiosity matches Democratic priorities like innovation, equity, and sustainability. Education and income are especially influential, as states with wealthier and more educated populations tend to favor progressive policies on social and economic issues. This shows how high composite scores often align with Democratic voting trends (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022).</p>
    
    <h4>Religion’s Role in Republican Strongholds</h3>
    <p>When religion is isolated as the dominant factor in the composite score, the landscape changes dramatically. States like Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee rank high due to strong religious ties, including high evangelical Christian populations and regular church attendance. These states overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in 2020, reflecting the Republican Party’s appeal to socially conservative voters. Here, religion often outweighs other factors like education or income, shaping a strong Republican identity (Pew Research Center, n.d.). </p>

    <p>Conversely, states with low religiosity, such as Vermont and Oregon, are more likely to lean Democratic, reflecting a cultural divide where secularism and progressive social policies take precedence. This divide highlights the contrast between states where religion is central and those that emphasize education or economic factors, showing the diverse values that shape voting patterns in the U.S.</p>
    
    <p>By breaking down the composite score, it becomes clear that education, income, and religion each play a key role in defining a state’s political identity. Understanding these patterns is crucial for predicting elections and creating strategies that connect with different groups of voters.</p>

    <h2>Favorability Over Time: Biden and Trump</h2>
    <p>When Joe Biden announced his candidacy for president in April 2019, his campaign emphasized a return to normalcy and national unity (“Joe Biden Announces Presidential Run”). As a result, Biden's favorability rose significantly in 2019 following his announcement to run for president, as his campaign focused on unifying the country and addressing key issues like healthcare and climate change. His favorability peaked in January 2021, immediately after his inauguration, with strong support from younger voters (18-34 years old), reaching 67%. This surge reflected widespread optimism about his leadership and ability to deliver on campaign promises (Gallup, 2023).</p>

    <figure style= "align-items: center; margin: 0px -50px">
        <iframe 
            src="chart3.html" 
            style="width:1200px; height:425px; border:none; transform: scale(0.8); overflow:hidden;">
        </iframe>
        <figcaption>Figure 3: Favorability Trends of Biden and Trump Over Time by Demographic Subcategory (2019-2023)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>However, this period didn’t last long. By December 2023, his favorability among younger voters plummeted to 30% (Gallup, 2023). The decline reflects growing dissatisfaction with his administration’s handling of inflation and legislative stalemates. </p>

    <p>Donald Trump’s favorability over the same period showed less dramatic swings but revealed consistent polarization. His support remained strong among White voters, with favorability hovering around 50%. Interestingly, Trump’s favorability among people of color, historically a weaker demographic for Republicans, rose from 15% in January 2021 to 35% by late 2023 (Gallup, 2023). This suggests targeted outreach efforts aimed at diversifying his base may have paid off.</p>
    
    <p>Biden’s falling favorability eventually pushed him to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. With growing frustration from both voters and his own party over stalled progress on big promises like tackling inflation and healthcare, he announced early in 2024 that he wouldn’t run for reelection. This shook up the political scene, leaving Democrats scrambling to find a strong candidate while exposing divisions within the party.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Trump seized the moment. His steady support base and outreach to new voter groups helped him rally momentum. Focusing on issues like the economy and national security, he appealed to a broad audience and took advantage of the Democrats’ struggles. These factors paved the way for Trump to win the 2024 election, putting him back in the White House. This shift in the political landscape highlights just how much public perception and favorability can shape the direction of the country (Gallup, 2023).</p>
    
    <p>By analyzing these favorability trends in conjunction with demographic and state-level patterns, it becomes evident why Biden’s initial advantage eroded over time, setting the stage for a more competitive electoral landscape in 2024.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The 2020 Presidential Election revealed a deeply divided nation, shaped by shifting favorability trends, demographic divides, and state-level socio-political dynamics. Biden’s initial support among younger and urban voters contrasted with Trump’s enduring appeal among rural, religious, and less-educated populations. High composite score states, like Massachusetts and Colorado, favored Biden due to their educational and economic prosperity, while highly religious states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, leaned Republican, reflecting their cultural priorities. These patterns underscore the intricate interplay of education, income, and religion in shaping electoral outcomes, offering key insights for navigating the nation’s increasingly polarized political landscape.</p>
