    <h1>How Voter Trends and Favorability Shaped the 2020 Election</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The American political landscape is anything but static. Elections serve as snapshots of the nation's collective mindset, shaped by favorability trends, demographic patterns, and state-level dynamics. The 2020 Presidential Election was no exception, reflecting deep societal divisions and evolving political preferences. This article dives into the favorability ratings of Joe Biden and Donald Trump over time, explores how demographic factors influenced voter behavior, and examines state-level electoral trends through the lens of composite socio-political scores. By connecting these threads, we aim to understand what these patterns reveal about the future of American elections.</p>

    <h2>Favorability Over Time: Biden and Trump</h2>
    <p>When Joe Biden announced his candidacy for president in April 2019, his campaign emphasized a return to normalcy and national unity (“Joe Biden Announces Presidential Run”). His message resonated strongly at first, but favorability is a moving target, shaped by the winds of political and social change.</p>

    </figure> -->
    <p>Biden’s favorability peaked in January 2021, immediately following his inauguration. During this period, his ratings soared among younger voters (18-34 years old), reaching 67%. Optimism around his administration's potential to address issues like healthcare, education, and climate change fueled this initial wave of support. However, this honeymoon period didn’t last long. By December 2023, his favorability among younger voters plummeted to 30%. The decline reflects growing dissatisfaction with his administration’s handling of inflation and legislative stalemates (“Biden’s Approval Ratings in 2023”).</p>

    <p>Donald Trump’s favorability over the same period showed less dramatic swings but revealed consistent polarization. His support remained strong among White voters, with favorability hovering around 50%. Interestingly, Trump’s favorability among people of color, historically a weaker demographic for Republicans, rose from 15% in January 2021 to 35% by late 2023. This suggests targeted outreach efforts aimed at diversifying his base may have paid off (“American Presidential Candidates Favorability”).</p>

    <h2>Demographic Voting Patterns in 2020</h2>
    <p>The 2020 Presidential Election wasn’t just about the candidates; it was a reflection of the diverse, complex makeup of the American electorate. Voter turnout reached record highs, with citizens from all walks of life exercising their right to vote despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The breakdown of voting preferences across gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, and religion provides a detailed tapestry of American political behavior.</p>

    <h3>Gender Divides</h3>
    <p>Gender was one of the most striking factors in voting behavior. Women strongly favored Joe Biden, with 55% voting for him compared to Donald Trump’s 44%. This aligns with broader trends where women prioritize issues like healthcare, reproductive rights, and social equality—key elements of Biden’s platform. On the other hand, men leaned slightly toward Trump, giving him 50% of their votes to Biden’s 48%. This divide highlights persistent gender differences in political priorities, with men often drawn to Trump’s focus on economic growth and national security.</p>

    <h3>Racial and Ethnic Differences</h3>
    <p>Race and ethnicity were among the most defining factors of the election. Black voters continued to be the backbone of the Democratic coalition, with 92% supporting Biden. This unwavering loyalty underscores the historical alignment of the Black community with the Democratic Party, driven by its emphasis on civil rights and social justice. Hispanic voters also leaned toward Biden at 61%, though regional and economic differences within this group created variations. For instance, Cuban Americans in Florida were more likely to support Trump due to his strong anti-socialist rhetoric.</p>

    <h3>Income and Economic Concerns</h3>
    <p>Income played a critical role in determining voter preferences. Among voters earning less than $50,000 annually, 54% supported Biden, while 44% voted for Trump. This group tends to prioritize issues like healthcare access and social safety nets, areas where Biden's platform resonated. For voters earning between $50,000 and $100,000, the split was closer—Trump narrowly led with 52% compared to Biden’s 47%. Interestingly, voters earning more than $100,000 skewed back toward Biden, with 55% supporting him. This suggests that wealthier voters, particularly in urban and suburban areas, were more influenced by Biden’s tax policies and progressive stance on social issues than by Trump’s economic deregulation.</p>

    <h3>Educational Polarization</h3>
    <p>Education remains one of the most reliable predictors of voting behavior in the United States. Among voters with postgraduate degrees, Biden achieved a commanding lead, securing 67% of their votes compared to Trump’s 32%. This trend extends to voters with four-year college degrees, where Biden maintained a 56% majority. However, among voters with some college education or a high school diploma or less, Trump led with 50% and 56%, respectively.</p>

    <h3>Religious Affiliations and Attendance</h3>
    <p>Religious affiliation and practice were also major factors influencing voter behavior. Among Protestant voters, Trump led with 59% support compared to Biden’s 40%. White evangelical Protestants, a core Republican demographic, gave Trump an overwhelming 83% of their votes. Meanwhile, Biden performed strongly among Catholics, narrowly leading 50% to Trump’s 49%. Hispanic Catholics, in particular, were a critical subgroup for Biden, with 66% supporting him.</p>

    <p>Religiously unaffiliated voters—those identifying as atheist, agnostic, or "nothing in particular"—were one of Biden’s strongest demographics. He garnered 71% of their votes, reflecting the Democratic Party’s appeal to secular and progressive values. This group’s influence is growing as younger, less religious voters make up an increasing share of the electorate.</p>
    
    <p>Religious attendance further differentiated voter preferences. Among those who attended religious services at least monthly, Trump led with 59%. In contrast, those who attended services less frequently overwhelmingly favored Biden, with 58% support. This divide highlights the cultural and ideological differences between more devout and secular voters.</p>

    <h3>Urban, Suburban, and Rural Dynamics</h3>
    <p>Geography often serves as a proxy for cultural and economic divisions. Biden dominated in urban areas, securing 66% of the vote to Trump’s 32%. In suburban areas, the margin was narrower but still in Biden’s favor at 54% to 44%. Rural areas, however, were Trump strongholds, with 65% of rural voters supporting him compared to Biden’s 34%.</p>
    
    <p>Among White voters specifically, geography played a significant role. Urban White voters leaned toward Biden (59%), while suburban White voters were more evenly split, with 47% supporting Biden and 51% backing Trump. Rural White voters heavily favored Trump, with 71% voting for him. This geographic polarization underscores the cultural divide between cosmopolitan, progressive urban centers and the more conservative values of rural America.</p>
    
    <h2>State-Level Dynamics: Composite Socio-Political Scores</h2>
    <p>Understanding state-level voting behavior requires analyzing a combination of factors that influence a region's cultural, economic, and social landscape. The composite socio-political score integrates three critical components—education, income, and religion—to provide a nuanced view of electoral dynamics across states. Each factor is normalized to ensure fair comparison, and the composite score reflects a weighted average based on the selected components.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure 3: Composite Score by State and 2020 Presidential Election Results</figcaption> -->
    </figure>

    
    <h3>How the Composite Score Works</h3>
    <p>The composite score is designed to reflect the relative performance of states in education, income, and religion. Here's how each component contributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Measures the level of educational attainment in a state. Higher scores indicate a greater percentage of residents with advanced degrees or higher education levels, often correlated with progressive voting trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Income:</strong> Reflects the economic prosperity of a state, based on normalized income levels. States with higher scores typically have stronger economies, higher wages, and a higher cost of living.</li>
        <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Captures the degree of religious adherence or significance within a state’s culture. States with high religion scores have a larger proportion of residents reporting strong religious affiliations or regular participation in religious activities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The composite score combines these components to create a broader picture of a state's socio-political profile. For example, a state with high education and income but low religiosity would still rank highly when all three factors are considered, but its position could shift significantly if only religion is emphasized.</p>
    
    <h3>Interpreting the Composite Score</h3>
    <p>To fully understand the composite score, it’s essential to consider how different components interact and what their implications are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All Components Selected:</strong> The composite score reflects a balanced view of education, income, and religion. States with high scores perform well across all three metrics, suggesting a mix of educational attainment, economic prosperity, and cultural cohesion.</li>
        <li><strong>Education Only:</strong> States with high scores in this scenario, like Massachusetts and Colorado, tend to lean Democratic due to the correlation between higher education levels and progressive values.</li>
        <li><strong>Income Only:</strong> Wealthier states, such as Connecticut and New Jersey, rank higher when income is prioritized, highlighting economic prosperity as a driver of voting behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Religion Only:</strong> When only religiosity is considered, states like Mississippi and Alabama dominate. These states often lean Republican, reflecting the strong influence of evangelical Christianity on conservative politics.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It’s important to note that a high score in any one category does not inherently indicate better or worse performance—it simply reflects the prominence of that factor in the state’s overall socio-political makeup. For example, a high religion score might suggest a cohesive cultural identity in some states, while in others, it might highlight ideological divides.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Findings from the Composite Score</h2>
    <p>The composite score reveals striking patterns in state-level voting behavior by integrating education, income, and religion. When all three components are considered, states with high composite scores—such as Massachusetts, Colorado, and Connecticut—emerge as Democratic strongholds. These states combine high levels of educational attainment and economic prosperity with moderate-to-low religiosity. Their progressive stance on issues such as healthcare, climate change, and social equity aligns with Democratic policies, making them reliable blue states in national elections. These states also serve as economic and cultural hubs, attracting diverse populations and fostering innovation, which further reinforces their alignment with Democratic values.</p>
    
    <h4>High Composite Scores and Democratic Voting</h3>
    <p>States that scored highest in the composite ranking when all three factors were included, such as Massachusetts, Colorado, and Connecticut, strongly supported Joe Biden in the 2020 Presidential Election. These states’ profiles—characterized by a combination of high education levels, robust economies, and moderate religious influence—reflect their alignment with Democratic ideals. Education and income are particularly significant, as states with more educated populations and higher incomes tend to favor progressive policies on social and economic issues. These trends underscore how high composite scores often correlate with Democratic voting patterns, driven by a shared emphasis on innovation, equity, and sustainability.</p>
    
    <h4>Religion’s Role in Republican Strongholds</h3>
    <p>When religion is isolated as the dominant factor in the composite score, the landscape changes dramatically. States like Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee rise to the top due to their strong religious adherence, characterized by high rates of evangelical Christianity and regular church attendance. These states overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in 2020, reflecting the Republican Party’s appeal to socially conservative and religiously motivated voters. For these states, religion plays a central role in shaping cultural identity and political alignment, often outweighing factors such as economic disparity or lower education levels. This finding highlights the critical influence of religiosity in defining Republican strongholds, where issues such as family values, religious freedom, and traditionalism resonate deeply with the electorate.</p>
    
    <p>Conversely, states with low religiosity, such as Vermont and Oregon, are more likely to lean Democratic, reflecting a cultural divide where secularism and progressive social policies take precedence. The stark contrast between states that prioritize religion and those that emphasize education and income underscores the complexity of the U.S. electoral landscape, where different values and priorities shape voter behavior in profoundly different ways.</p>
    
    <p>By analyzing the composite score through these distinct lenses, it becomes clear that education, income, and religion each play a pivotal role in defining the political identity of states. Understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting electoral outcomes and crafting strategies that resonate with diverse constituencies.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The 2020 Presidential Election revealed a deeply divided nation, shaped by shifting favorability trends, demographic divides, and state-level socio-political dynamics. Biden’s initial support among younger and urban voters contrasted with Trump’s enduring appeal among rural, religious, and less-educated populations. High composite score states, like Massachusetts and Colorado, favored Biden due to their educational and economic prosperity, while highly religious states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, leaned Republican, reflecting their cultural priorities. These patterns underscore the intricate interplay of education, income, and religion in shaping electoral outcomes, offering key insights for navigating the nation’s increasingly polarized political landscape.</p>
